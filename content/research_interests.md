# Research interests

I am mainly interested in high-dimensional and nonparametric statistics. More precisely, my research interests include
statistical machine learning, Bayesian nonparametrics, uncertainty quantification and inverse problems.

Topics I have worked on include:
- Bayesian nonparametrics
- (Deep) Gaussian processes
- Tree-based methods (Random Forests, CART, PÃ³lya Trees, BART,...)
- Uncertainty quantification
- Variational Bayes
- Inverse problems
- Differential privacy
